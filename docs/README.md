# Usage

This directory contains three notebooks that demonstrate how to use the `vibecheck` library:

1. **0-Setup.ipynb**: This notebook demonstrates how to create a new database to store your results.
2. **1-Usage.ipynb**: This is an example of how your students will interact with the content review widgets. You can use this template to create your own notebooks, or copy and paste the code from this notebook into existing notebooks.
3. **2-Review.ipynb**: This notebook demonstrates how to review submitted results.

As an administrator, you can also optionally view summary statistics inline in the notebook by running the cell and pressing the "View Data" button. This button is only visible if you have the Datatops admin credentials for the corresponding project/server for that cell.
